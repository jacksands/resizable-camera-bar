A super simple module for Foundry VTT v13. It lets you drag and resize the camera bar using a small handle located at the bottom-right corner of the bar. The handle always stays in that spot, no matter where the bar is positioned.

To prevent resizing issues that make the camera bar excessively large, the size is capped at max-width: 500px for vertical bars and max-height: 400px for horizontal ones.

Just install the module and activate it in your world to use it.
